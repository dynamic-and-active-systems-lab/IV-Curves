classdef IVcurve < handle
    %This class takes the current voltage (IV) data from lab experiments 
    %utilizing a Keithley Source Meter and a Verasol 2 Solar Simulator.
    %
    %The data is split into individual IV curves with the recorded
    %temperature, depth, water quality, and irradiance that the IV was
    %performed at. An ID is assigned to the IV curve and the short circuit
    %current (ISC), open circuit voltage (VOC), and maximum power point
    %(MPP), are calculated from the IV data.
    %
    %The experiments were conducted to determine effects of temperature,
    %water quality, depth, and irradiance on IV curve parameters
    %

    %parameters with respective sizes
