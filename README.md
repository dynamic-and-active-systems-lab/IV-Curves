# IV-Curves
All IV curves from laboratory characterization of silicon solar cells.

The water types correspond to Jerlov's water type classification (N. G. Jerlov,Marine optics.    Elsevier, 1976). 

These water types can also be found in previous literature (P.  Jenkins,  S.  Messenger,  K.  M.  Trautz,  S.  I.  Maximenko,D.  Goldstein,  D.  Scheiman,  R.  Hoheisel,  and  R.  J.  Walters,“High-bandgap  solar  cells  for  underwater  photovoltaic  applica-tions,”Photovoltaics, IEEE Journal of, vol. 4, no. 1, pp. 202–207,2014).

Download both the IVcurve.m file and respective IV_Curve water type .mat file

Each IV curve .mat file contain all IV curves at the respective water type.

Water type "Type I" contains IV curves for a zero irradiance curve (depth -2) and AM1.5G standard spectrum (depth -1).

The IVcurve.m file contains the IVcurve class and details explaining each variable.
